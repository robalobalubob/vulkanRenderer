/**
 * VMA Implementation File
 * 
 * This file is required to compile the Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) implementation.
 * VMA is a header-only library, but it needs exactly one .cpp file to define
 * VMA_IMPLEMENTATION before including the header.
 * 
 * This creates the actual compiled implementation of all VMA functions.
